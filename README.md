# python-projects

This repository contains my journey through the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. Each day covers a new concept with hands-on projects, ranging from basic Python to building websites, games, data science, and automation tools.

## Goals

- Strengthen core Python skills
- Build real-world projects daily
- Learn libraries like Flask, Pandas, Tkinter, etc.
- Showcase work publicly on GitHub

## Project Structure

Each folder contains the project for a specific day.
